# Suryansh's Personal Website

This repository contains a simple, responsive single‑page site built to introduce **Suryansh**, a first‑year Computer Science &amp; Engineering student at KIIT University.  The design is inspired by sleek product landing pages—such as the Tesla Cybertruck and OpenAI websites—and follows best practices for portfolio sites:

* A **hero section** with a compelling headline, supporting subheading and a primary call‑to‑action.  According to web design guidelines, hero sections should quickly communicate who you are and why visitors should care【27243176053922†L20-L37】.
* An **About** section that tells your story.  Portfolio experts recommend including your name, a short biography and what drives you【480130761225280†L238-L257】.
* A **Projects** section where you can showcase what you're building.  Even if you’re just starting out, this placeholder encourages you to share your work【480130761225280†L214-L221】.
* A **Contact** section with easy ways to reach you.  Clear calls to action help visitors connect【480130761225280†L317-L324】.

## Contents

* `index.html` – the markup for the site
* `styles.css` – styling for a dark‑themed, futuristic aesthetic
* `images/hero.png` – a high‑resolution, abstract tech background used in the hero section

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally.  No build step is required.
3. To deploy online, you can:
   * **GitHub Pages** – create a new repository named `suryansh-portfolio`, add these files and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings (select the `main` branch as the source).  GitHub will host the site at `https://&lt;your-username&gt;.github.io/suryansh-portfolio/`.
   * **Netlify/Vercel** – drag and drop the project folder into Netlify or Vercel.  Both services will automatically detect it’s a static site and provide you with a public URL.

## Customization Tips

* **Update your projects** – as you build more projects, replace the placeholder text in the Projects section with links, images or descriptions of your work.
* **Add a profile photo** – add your own photo to the About section by inserting an `<img>` tag and storing the image in the `images` folder.
* **Adjust colors** – modify the CSS variables at the top of `styles.css` to fine‑tune the color scheme.

## Credits

* The hero image was generated to evoke a futuristic, tech‑forward feeling.
* Design decisions draw upon guidance for effective hero sections and portfolio elements【27243176053922†L20-L37】【480130761225280†L238-L257】.
